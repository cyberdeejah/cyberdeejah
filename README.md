## üõ°Ô∏è **My Approach to VAPT**

As a **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** professional, I focus on a **methodical, risk-driven approach** that ensures the security of web applications, networks, systems, and infrastructure. My typical process involves:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information on the target environment through passive and active techniques.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using automated tools to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system.
3. **Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit discovered vulnerabilities to assess the impact and risk.
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Testing the attacker‚Äôs ability to maintain persistence and move laterally within the system.
5. **Reporting**: Providing clear, actionable findings and recommendations to improve security posture.

- **Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap**
- **Wireshark, Nikto, Hydra, Gobuster**
- **OWASP ZAP, SQLmap**
- **Docker, Kubernetes (for containerized testing)**
